# Word-Series Averaging

The Word-Series Averaging methods are used for reduce the computational cost for highly oscillatory ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems. On the other hand, these method add errors in the process but they are bounded by O(1/w^r). where w is the frequency and r is the lenght of the words uses.

More information of these method can be found in the documentation and its bibliography.

This repository is written fot Matlab and needs symbolic calculation tools.
